## Description

This app idea came from a real life experience.  My friend invited about 9 people to a bachelor's dinner.  
It was a great event.  But what a buzzkill when the tab arrived and we wanted to split it 8 ways, while
dividing the Man of the Hour's tab up among us.  The waitstaff flat out declined to do this for us, so one
of my friends had to undertake the task with pen and paper.

User Story:
AS A waiter,
I WANT an app that takes the splitting of dining tabs out of my hands and diners' hands,
SO THAT I can smoothly receive payment from customers.
